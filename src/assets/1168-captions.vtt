00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
911: And so she's having breathing difficulties?

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.060
NURSE: She's short of breath and her vital signs are a bit elevated now.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.840
911: OK, would I be able to speak to her?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.700
NURSE: She's not-- she's in her room now.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.680
911: Is she's able to speak in full sentences?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.790
NURSE: She is, yeah, but she's very anxious and agitated, yes.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.640
911: Is she going to be cooperative with the aid crew?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.940
NURSE: Is she what?

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.120
911: Is she going to be cooperative with aid crew?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.840
NURSE: I should think so, because she really wants to go to the ER.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.280
911: OK, all righty, can I get your name?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.360
NURSE: My name is [redacted].

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.160
911: Alrighty, I've notified my aid crew, OK, just do your best to keep her as comfortable as you can, nothing further by mouth, if anything changes or gets worse, just give us a call back.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.320
NURSE: I will, thank you.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.540
911: You're welcome, bye.
