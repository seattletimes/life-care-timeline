00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
911: OK, what's going on with her today?

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:09.200
NURSE: Yes she just has-- her O2 sat dropped to 48, and it will go up to in the 50s and she's on five liters of oxygen.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.800
911: She's conscious, correct?

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500
NURSE: Yes, she's very confused right now.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
911: OK, so you would say she's having difficulty breathing or?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.640
NURSE: Absolutely yeah.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.870
911: OK, can she speak normally?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.960
NURSE: No -- she's confused, she's just talking and she's just not making a lot of sense.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.140
911: OK, does she have any history of diabetes?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.980
NURSE: No.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.040
911: OK, any other medical history that might be relevant?

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.120
NURSE: CHF, and she was diagnosed with pneumonia a couple of days ago and they started her on antibiotics.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.380
911: OK.
