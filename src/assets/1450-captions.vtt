00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.840
NURSE: Hello, this is [redacted] at Life Care Center of Kirkland. I'm calling because I have a patient who was displaying respiratory symptoms.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.320
911: OK, and is the patient awake right
now?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.840
NURSE: He is.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.800
911: OK. How old is he?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.480
NURSE: He is--- birthdate is [redacted] '45. His age of 74.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.800
911: OK, and you said that's respiratory issues he's been having?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.640
NURSE: Yeah. I can give you more detail if you want.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.200
911: Yes, please.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:49.520
NURSE: Experiencing shortness of breath, O2 sats 85% on three liters, I just turned him up to 3.5 liters and his temperature is 97.5, heart rate 138, I called the doctor and she wanted to send him out.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.200
911: Yeah, absolutely, and has he had-- I apologize, has he had a fever recently? You may have said the temperature and I missed it.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.980
NURSE: Temperature 97.5, so no fever.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.080
911: Okay. And has he had any exposure recently to people who have traveled outside of the country?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.680
NURSE: He is at Life Care Center of Kirkland, so.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.080
911: Understood.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280
NURSE: So this is-- we've had a couple coronavirus cases.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.480
911: OK. OK, so I've got them notified for you. Can I just grab your name?

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.760
NURSE: Yeah, it's [redacted].

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.080
911: And I'm showing the phone number
ending in 2, 3, 2, 3. Is that the best phone number for you?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:39.720
NURSE: You know, I'm not sure, actually, because we've been bombarded by media recently, so I'm not sure if-- I'm not sure if that number is the best number, so I can give you an alternative.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.080
911: Ok, perfect.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.000
NURSE: Yeah, just I mean, use that one as the primary, but if you can't get through [redacted].

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:55.440
911: OK, I'll go ahead and let them know that's an alternate number. I do have them notified, if you can just keep an eye on him if anything changes or worsens in the meantime, go ahead and give us a call back, OK?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.360
NURSE: Will do.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.760
911: All right. Thanks so much. Bye bye.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.640
NURSE: Thank you. Bye bye.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.520

LCC: No, he's on the other side of the building, I'm not sure.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.880

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.720
LCC: All right.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.880
