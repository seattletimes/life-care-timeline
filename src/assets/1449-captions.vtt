00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.860

her, would she not understand my questions?

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.740
NURSE: She does answer appropriately.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.230

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.580

symptoms is she having?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:25.100

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.560

exposed to someone with the Coronavirus, is that correct?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.800

NURSE: Different side of the building.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.620
911: What we're gonna ask you to do is we're gonna ask you to take her outside and make sure she's wearing a mask for the aid crew.

NURSE: OK.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.300

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380
911: OK.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.380
NURSE: Alright I'll do my best to get her
out, but she's on five liters, I have to get her to a tank.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.020
911: Yeah, I know. I apologize for the inconvenience, but it's just for our aid crew safety, yeah.
