00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320
911: What's going on with her today?

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:10.300
NURSE: I just helped her into the bed and
she's having respiratory distress, O2 sats at 68 with oxygen.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.160
911: OK hold on, you said she's having trouble breathing?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.180
NURSE: Yes.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.060
911: Is she able to talk in normal sentences or does he have to take a lot of breaks in between?

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.680
NURSE: She has to take a lot of-- It takes
a lot of energy for her to make a few words.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.940
911: OK but does she take a lot of breaks for her breathing or is she able to say a full sentence?

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.100
NURSE: She is able to but it takes a longer.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.700
911: OK, and you said her O2 sats were what?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:49.960
NURSE: It was 68 and it went up to 70 and
that's the highest I could get it on oxygen.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.440
911: OK, and what's your name?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.500
NURSE: [Redacted].

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.059
911: OK, is someone able to direct the crew
to where she's at when they get there?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.260
NURSE: Yes.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:07.740
911: OK, just go ahead and keep her calm and comfortable, nothing to eat or drink, try not to have her do too much moving around, if anything changes, just go ahead and call back so we can give them an update.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.420
NURSE: Alright, thank you.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.000
911: Bye.
